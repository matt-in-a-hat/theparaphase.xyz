This is the source for theparaphase.xyz.

To add files to the file list on the site, [upload a file to `assets/goodies/` folder](https://github.com/matt-in-a-hat/theparaphase.xyz/upload/gh-pages/assets/goodies)

This uses the [Tactile theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/tactile) of the [Jekyll site builder](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll). Files within that theme directory can by copied & changed here if/as needed (e.g. _layout/default.html has been overridden to remove the default footer).
